# Overview

> Hello and welcome to Worth API! 
Here at Worth we want to ensure a seamless onboarding experience and have created this guide for you and your businesses. 
This guide will show you how to get started using the Worth API documentation. 
Should you have any questions please feel free to reach out to a Worth team member to better assist you. 
Thanks!

## Credentialing

Please provide the following credentials to the Worth Team to create your admin account:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Email

These credentials will allow you to **send invites** to merchants and/or onboard businesses via single business onboard.

> **Note:** Sending over a *service email* will also work to set up API credentialing access.

## Email Access Link

You should have received an email from [no-reply@worth.com](mailto:no-reply@worth.com) with this email body requesting you to log in.
<br />**Note**: This link will expire within 7 days of receiving this email.

## Create Login

Upon clicking the link in the email, you will be prompted to **create a password**.\
These credentials will allow you access to make API calls such as [Add Business](/api-reference/add-or-update-business/add-business) and get business information such as [KYB](/api-reference/integration/facts/kyb) and [KYC](/api-reference/integration/verification/kyc-ownership-verification).

## Authentication

Accessing the API relies on a username/password authentication flow. Using the [Customer Sign In](/api-reference/auth/sign-in/customer-sign-in) route, you’ll capture **3 key identifiers** that are specific to your team: the `id_token`, the `refresh_token`, and the `customerID`.

* `id_token`: represents the authorization (Bearer) token for the authenticated user and their role within the Worth platform.\
  *Note: for security purposes, this is a relatively short-lived token and must be refreshed programmatically.*
* `refresh_token`: represents the token needed at [Customer Refresh Token](/api-reference/auth/sign-in/customer-refresh-token) when `id_token` is expired. Upon successful refresh, a new `id_token` and `refresh_token` will be returned in the response.
* `customer_details.id`: represents the instance ID of the user's company where other API operations will take place. Some endpoints require this ID (referred to as `customerID`) for querying and submitting business data.

## Add Business

* Adding a Business is the next critical step in getting started with the Worth API docs.
* The [Add Business](/api-reference/add-or-update-business/add-business) route creates a unique business ID. This ID is used to make many of the **GET** calls listed in the documentation.
* While the Add Business route only requires **four** data fields to make a successful call, it is highly recommended to add as much business and owner information to this POST call to capture robust KYB and KYC information.
* More information about required and recommended data fields can be found in the **API reference** tab.

## Responses

* **The FINAL STEP!** Once you have added a business, it’s time to pull back the data!
* It’s important to note that **GET** responses associated with business information will require a `businessID` in the endpoint URL. This `businessID` is generated via the Add Business endpoint. Once this initial step is complete, you will be able to make several **GET** calls to retrieve cases, business details, and reports.
