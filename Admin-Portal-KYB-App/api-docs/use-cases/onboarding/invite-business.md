# Invite business

This sequence diagram demonstrates the efficient business onboarding process facilitated by Worth UI, where invitations are sent to businesses, guiding them through a seamless registration and onboarding experience via the platform.

***

## **Process breakdown**

### **1. Onboarding API calls**

* **Authentication**:\
  Upon accepting initial invitation or signing in, the customer receives the following tokens:

  * `id_token`: used for secure api communication. (**required for all api calls.**)
  * `refresh_token`: is used to renew `id_token`.

  **Note**: `id_token` is always required for secure api communication. See [Customer Sign In page](https://docs.worthai.com/api-reference/auth/sign-in/customer-sign-in) for more info.

* **Invite Business**:\
  The customer provides business information in the following structure:
  ```json  theme={null}
    {
        "business": {
            "name": "Business Name",
            "mobile": "1234567890"
        },
        "applicants": [
            {
                "first_name": "Applicant First Name",
                "last_name": "Applicant Last Name",
                "email": "applicant@email.com",
                "mobile": "1234567890"
            }
        ]
    }
  ```
  * **Lightning Verification**:\
    **Lightning Verify** instantly checks and confirms company details. It gathers information like a company's name, address, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) into a single, customizable form that applicants fill out. Upon submission, verification results are available in the Worth Case Management Platform.\
    **Getting started**: Contact your Worth Custom Success team to enable Lightning Verify.
    ```json  theme={null}
      {
          "business": {
              "name": "Business Name",
              "mobile": "1234567890"
          },
          "applicants": [
              {
                  "first_name": "Applicant First Name",
                  "last_name": "Applicant Last Name",
                  "email": "applicant@email.com",
                  "mobile": "1234567890"
              }
          ],
          "is_lightning_verify": true
      }
    ```

This triggers email to applicant to complete the onboarding process. See [Send Business Invite documentation](https://docs.worthai.com/api-reference/case/invites/send-business-invite) for further information.
